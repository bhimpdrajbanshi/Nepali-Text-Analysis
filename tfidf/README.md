## Introduction

This repository aims to support researchers and developers in analyzing and processing Nepali text. Given the unique characteristics and challenges of the Nepali language, this project provides specialized that cater to these needs. Our initial focus is on the implementation of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a fundamental technique in text analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nepali-text-analysis.git
    cd nepali-text-analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Features

- **TF-IDF Implementation:** Calculate the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for a set of Nepali documents.
- **Tokenization:** Split text into words or phrases, tailored for Nepali.
- **Stop Words Removal:** Remove common Nepali stop words to focus on significant terms.

## Usage

### TF-IDF Implementation

The `tfidf.py` script demonstrates how to calculate the TF-IDF matrix for a collection of Nepali documents. You can customize the script with your own dataset.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample documents in Nepali
documents = [
    "नेपाल एक सुन्दर देश हो।",
    "हिमालय नेपालमा छन्।",
    "सगरमाथा नेपालमा सबैभन्दा अग्लो चुचुरो हो।"
]
